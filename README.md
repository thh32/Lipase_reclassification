# A proposed update for the classification and description of bacterial lipolytic enzymes

This is a repository for the deposit and classification of lipolytic enzymesbased on the proposed classification system in Hitch and Clavel (TBP).

## Compare a new lipolytic enzyme to the representatives

If you have a novel lipolytic enzyme and wish to either identify which family it belongs to or confirm it as a novel family we have provided the Pairwise_analysis.ipynb file. For this you must have jupyter notebook installed. To run this script place your proteins amino acid sequence into the 'Representative_sequences.faa' file and run the code. ClustalW is used to conduct pairwise comparisons between each of the protein pairs within the file. Afterwards the similarity of the proteins is calculated and provided in the output file 'Pairwise_similarities.csv'.
